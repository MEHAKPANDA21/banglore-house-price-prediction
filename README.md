🏠 Bangalore House Price Predictor
This project is a machine learning-powered web application that estimates housing prices in Bangalore, India. Built with precision and user accessibility in mind, it leverages multiple regression models and a clean Streamlit interface to deliver accurate price predictions based on key property features.
📁 Dataset Source
The model was trained on the Bangalore House Prices dataset, sourced from Kaggle
🔗 View Dataset on Kaggle
It contains rich information including location, total square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), bathrooms, and sale price — essential for developing a robust prediction system.
📌 Problem Statement
Bangalore’s real estate market is highly variable, with prices influenced by factors such as locality, infrastructure, and property size. This model aims to assist buyers, sellers, and analysts in making informed decisions by providing data-driven price estimates.
